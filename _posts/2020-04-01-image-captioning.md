## Introduction
About image captioning, there are three well-studied approaches to automatic image captioning: retrieval based image captioning, template based image captioning, and deep neural network based image captioning. Moreover, each approach can be divided into some subcategories based on the specific method and framework. In terms of the retrieval based model, Hodosh et al. establish a framework for sentence-based image description by ranking a given pool of captions. Ordonez et al. used 1 Million Captioned Photographs associated with human-generated description to develop an automatic image description method by filtering and retrieving. The advantage of retrieval-based methods is that always return well-formed human-written captions, but in some conditions, these captions may not be able to describe the image properly. Another method is called the template based model, generating caption through a syntactically and semantically constrained process. Yang et al. first extracted nouns, verbs, scenes, and prepositions from the image then used these to generate the sentence by the statistical language model. Li et al. used a similar method, the whole process can be divided into two steps, phrase selection and phrase fusion. Compared with the retrieval based model, the caption generated by this approach is more relevant, but the sentence is usually simple and less creative. Besides, with the development of the neural network, some generation method
like seq-2-seq model has been used to solve this problem, motivated by the neural machine translation. Kiros et al. brought the encoder-decoder framework into image captioning area by unifying joint image-text embedding models through multimodal neural language models. Vinyals et al. used to CNN as encoder and LSTM as decoder for image captioning, by the pre-trained image representation and treating the last hidden layer as input to the decoder. You et al. proposes a new image captioning approach that combines the top-down and bottom-up approaches through a semantic attention model. Automatic image captioning is a relatively new task, the network with encoder and decoder is widely used in this area, currently. Besides, some improvement tricks like attention mechanisms used in other areas like machine translation can also apply in image captioning.


## System Architecture(Online & Offline)
About the architecture of recommender systems, it is a difficult problem in industry. There are two main components called recall layer and ranking layer.
