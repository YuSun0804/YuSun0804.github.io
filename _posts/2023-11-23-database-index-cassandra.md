## Introduction
Index is a data structure that helps the database system obtain data efficiently. It improves the data retrieval process in the database at the cost of adding additional write operations and storage space for maintaining the index data structure. To search an entry, database would search the index for the entry first, and index is pointing to real physical location of the entry.
